== How to build on Unix/Linux

It is very easy to build the code examples on Linux or another Unix-compatible system with GNU Make, such as macOS or even Cygwin.

=== Prerequisites

1. Install essential build tools: C compiler, linker, GNU Make.
2. Build OpenSSL 3.0 and install it to /opt/openssl-3.0.0/ .

=== Build code examples

1. Enter a directory containing the code examples for a particular chapter, for example:
[source,shell]
----
cd Chapter02
----

2. Build with GNU Make:
[source,shell]
----
make
